# SSE vs WebSockets

## Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Protocol**: Uses HTTP/1.1.
- **Direction**: Unidirectional (server to client).
- **Connection**: Persistent connection where the server can push updates to the client.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for applications where updates are sent from the server to the client, such as live news feeds, stock price updates, or real-time notifications.
- **Complexity**: Simpler to implement compared to WebSockets.
- **Browser Support**: Supported by most modern browsers, but not all (e.g., Internet Explorer does not support SSE).

## WebSockets
- **Protocol**: Uses ws:// or wss:// (WebSocket protocol).
- **Direction**: Bidirectional (full-duplex communication).
- **Connection**: Persistent connection allowing both client and server to send messages to each other.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for real-time applications requiring two-way communication, such as chat applications, multiplayer games, or collaborative tools.
- **Complexity**: More complex to implement than SSE.
- **Browser Support**: Widely supported by modern browsers.

## Summary
- **SSE** is simpler and best for server-to-client updates.
- **WebSockets** provide full-duplex communication and are suitable for interactive applications requiring real-time, two-way communication.

Both technologies have their own strengths and are chosen based on the specific needs of the application.
